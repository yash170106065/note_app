# Note Taking App
Note-taking applications (also called note-taking apps) allow students to: Store all notes and important information digitally, usually in a cloud-based storage system. Type, write, and draw notes on the device of choice just as one would using pen and paper.

```
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3.7
```
